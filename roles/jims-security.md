Jim's Security, also known as Jim or Camera Man, targets three players each night. If one (or several, see Interactions below) of Jim's targets die during the night, Jim will recieve a list with four alive players: three randomly generated players and one fixed player who was the one that performed the kill. 

There are no restrictions on who the camera man can target.
