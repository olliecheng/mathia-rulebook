## What is Mafia?
Mafia is a strategy game, which models conflict between multiple groups. The simplest form of Mafia is conflict between just two groups: the uninformed majority (the Town) and the informed majority (the Mafia). However, the version played in Mathia is a little more complex. Below is an outline of the major alignments involved in Mathia.

## Alignments
- **Mafia**  
 The Mafia are an informed minority group. The want to kill the town players. Each Mafia faction (if there are multiple) is allowed to attempt to kill one player each night. This isn't a guaranteed kill, as other power roles can perform actions which nullify the kill. The Mafia know the identities of the other Mafia, hence why they are an *informed* group.
- **Town**  
 The Town is one large group of uninformed players. They don't know the identity of the Mafia, but know the Mafia exist and seek to kill all the Mafia players. Like the Mafia, the town can lynch (kill) one player every night through a voting process.
- **Neutral**  
 The Neutral roles are players who win by completing certain tasks (i.e. convince town to lynch a certain player, etc). Neutral players have no alignment and can ally with both the Mafia or the Town (or both). However, they are an uninformed group of players, and don't know the Mafia identities.

## Power Roles
Power roles are players who can perform special actions each night. At the start of the game, power roles are assigned and they are kept for the duration of the game, or until the player dies. They can be aligned with both the Mafia and the Town.
